From 2014 to 2017, I hosted a radio show at WVUM 90.5 FM called Spacewaves. This show explored a genre sometimes called "Future Bass", but that is a poor descriptor. I found the music to be most inspired by Flume's 2012 eponymous album, but later on, Porter Robinson's "Worlds" album also was quite influential and moving for the scene.
