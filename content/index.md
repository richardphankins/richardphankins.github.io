title: Richard Hankins - Personal Site
---
I'm Richard Hankins. I'm creating this site as a work-in-progress index of where I am and what I've done, in a semi-professional context.  I'm currently the Executive Director for [Partnership for Smarter Growth](https://psgrichmond.org), but have also done work for both [RVA Rapid Transit](https://rvarapidtransit.org) and [Transit Alliance](https://transitalliance.miami) Miami.

I made this [[Website]] with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), [Spaceship](https://spaceship.com) and [Github Pages.](https://pages.github.com) If there's interest (even personally), I'll make a walkthrough that also addresses some of my personal hiccups throughout the process.

In college, I had a radio show called [[Spacewaves]].

In 2019, I kept an extensive travel blog of my 7 months backpacking Asia.  You can read it on my [medium](https://richintransit.medium.com) account.
